Problem Description:

Seasonal Naïve Baseline Forecast for Power Consumption

This task establishes a baseline forecasting model for monthly power consumption using the Seasonal Naïve approach. Baseline models are essential in time-series analysis, as they provide a simple reference point against which more advanced models (ARIMA, SARIMA, etc.) can be evaluated.

Power consumption data typically exhibits strong annual seasonality, making the Seasonal Naïve method an appropriate and interpretable benchmark.

1. Seasonal Naïve Forecast Generation

In the Seasonal Naïve method, the forecast for a given month is assumed to be equal to the observed consumption from the same month in the previous year.

A seasonal period of 12 is used, corresponding to monthly data.
Forecasts are generated by shifting the historical Consumption series by 12 time steps.
The shifted values aligned with the test period form the baseline forecast.

This approach assumes that seasonal patterns remain stable over time and does not attempt to model trends or irregular fluctuations.

2. Visualization and Comparison

The plot compares:

Actual power consumption values (blue line),
Seasonal Naïve forecasts (orange line).

Interpretation:

The Seasonal Naïve forecast closely follows the recurring seasonal peaks and troughs, confirming the presence of strong annual seasonality.
Deviations occur during periods of rapid growth or abnormal demand, as the model does not account for trends or external influences.
Despite its simplicity, the Seasonal Naïve model provides a reasonable approximation of consumption behavior.

3. Evaluation Using MAE

The baseline forecast is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE):

MAE measures the average absolute difference between actual consumption values and the Seasonal Naïve predictions.
A lower MAE indicates better baseline performance.

The resulting MAE serves as a benchmark error level, helping to determine whether more complex models (such as SARIMA or SARIMAX) provide meaningful improvements over a simple seasonal repetition strategy.

Conclusion

The Seasonal Naïve model:

Captures the dominant annual seasonal pattern in power consumption,
Is easy to implement and interpret,
Serves as a strong baseline for comparison.

Any advanced forecasting model should ideally achieve lower MAE than the Seasonal Naïve forecast, justifying the added complexity.
