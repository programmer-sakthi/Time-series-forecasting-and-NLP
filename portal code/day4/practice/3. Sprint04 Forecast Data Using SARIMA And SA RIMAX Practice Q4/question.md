problem Description — SARIMAX-Based Stock price Forecasting with Exogenous variables
Stock price movements are influenced not only by their own past values and seasonal patterns but also by additional market-related factors such as momentum indicators, trading activity, and smoothed price signals. TO account for both internal time-series structure
and external influences, the SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables) model extends SARIMA by incorporating explanatory variables into the forecasting process.
In this problem, you are given monthly stock market data that includes Open, High, LOW, Close prices, trading volume, and engineered features such as closing price differences, short-term and long-term moving averages (SMA_IO, SMA_30), and Simple Exponential
Smoothing (SES). The Close price is used as the target variable, while selected indicators serve as exogenous regressors.
A SARIMAX(I, O, 1) x (3, 1, 1, 12) model has been trained:
• The non—seasonal component (1, O, 1) captures short-term autocorrelation in closing prices.
• The seasonal component (3, 1, 1, 12) models annual seasonality in monthly stock data.
• Exogenous variables help explain variations in price movements beyond pure autoregressive behavior.
The visualization presents:
• Training data (blue line): Historical closing prices used to fit the model.
• Actual test data (orange dashed line): Observed closing prices in the evaluation period.
• Forecasted values (green dashed line): Predictions generated by the SARIMAX model using both historical patterns and external regressors.
Based on this visualization, you are required to:
• Evaluate how the inclusion of exogenous variables affects forecast behavior compared to a standard SARIMA model.
• Analyze how well the SARIMAX forecasts track the direction and magnitude Of actual price movements.
• Identify periods where the model underestimates or overestimates the closing prices.
• Discuss the strengths and limitations Of using external indicators for stock price forecasting.
The objective Of this problem is to assess the effectiveness Of the SARIMAX model in capturing complex stock price dynamics by combining seasonality, autoregressive structure, and exogenous information, and to interpret its performance through visual comparison with
actual market data.
