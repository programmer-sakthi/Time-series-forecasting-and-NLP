Problem Description – Seasonal Naïve Forecasting for Stock Closing Prices 

Forecasting stock prices requires understanding both short-term fluctuations and recurring seasonal patterns present in historical data. As a simple yet effective baseline approach, the Seasonal Naïve forecasting method assumes that future values will repeat the same pattern observed in the most recent corresponding seasonal period (for example, the same month in the previous year). Although it does not explicitly model trends or volatility, it provides a useful benchmark for evaluating more advanced forecasting models. 

In this problem, you are provided with monthly stock market data that includes Open, High, Low, Close prices, trading Volume, and derived indicators such as closing price differences, moving averages (SMA_10, SMA_30), and simple exponential smoothing (SES). The Close price is used as the target variable for forecasting. 

The visualization compares: 

Actual closing stock prices (blue line): Observed values over the test period. 
Seasonal Naïve forecasts (orange line): Predictions generated by repeating the closing prices from the same month in the previous seasonal cycle. 

Using this plot, you are required to: 

Analyze how closely the Seasonal Naïve forecasts follow the actual closing prices. 
Identify periods where the Seasonal Naïve method performs well, particularly when seasonality is stable. 
Highlight situations where the method fails to capture upward or downward trends and sudden price changes. 
Compare the simplicity and limitations of the Seasonal Naïve approach against more sophisticated forecasting models. 

The objective of this problem is to understand the role of Seasonal Naïve forecasting as a baseline model in time-series analysis and to evaluate its effectiveness and shortcomings when applied to real-world stock closing price data.
